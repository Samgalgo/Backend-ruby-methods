# 2) Write a program hangman.rb that contains a function called hangman.  The function's parameters are a word and an array of letters.  It returns a string showing the letters that have been guessed.  Call the function from within your program so that you know that it works.

# Example: hangman("bob",["b"]) should evaluate to "b_b"
# Example: hangman("alphabet",["a","h"]) should return "a__ha___"



#PROBLEM WAS NOT SOLVED, STILL WORKING ON IT BUT SUBMITTING HOMEWORK SO I DONT GET BEHIND ON OTHER HOMEWORK


def hangman (word, arr)
    new_arr = ()
    if word.include? "a"
        puts new_arr
    end 
    
end

hangman("bananas", ["a"])
